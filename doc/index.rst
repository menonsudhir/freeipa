Welcome to IdM QE IPA Tests' documentation!
============================================

IdM QE IPA Tests is a project designed to provide test suites for Red Hat's
Identity Management product--IPA.  These tests are primarily written in pyton
using pytest for the testing framework.  In addition they rely heavily on a
new python pytest plugin called multihost[#_].
