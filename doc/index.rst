Welcome to IPA PyTests' documentation!
======================================

IPA PyTests is a project designed to provide test suites for Red Hat's
Identity Management product--IPA.  These tests are written in python
using pytest for the testing framework.  In addition they rely heavily
on a new python pytest plugin called multihost[#_].
